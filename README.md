<h1 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi"> I am Dawid</h1>

Front-end development become my passion recently. Every day, I am trying to learn something new in this field, because it gives me huge satisfaction. I like challenges and solving problems. I graduated from computer science, but in front-end area I'm mostly self-taught. I like to get to know the subject well before moving further. I am also interested in graphic design and always pay attention to this in projects.

I have experience in ecommerce and SEO, what can be desirable in some front-end positions. I am also developing my own Wordpress website and Woocommerce store [Myslczlowieku.pl](https://www.myslczlowieku.pl/), where can i see how it work under the hood. Non Front-end tools I am fimiliar with:

- Wordpress, Woocomerce
- Google Search Console, Analytics, Optimise, Tag Menager
- Ahrefs, Senuto, SurferSeo, Sitebulb, HotJar, Yoast, RankMath
